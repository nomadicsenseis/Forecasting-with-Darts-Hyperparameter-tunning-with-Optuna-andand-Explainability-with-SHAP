    "Before trainning the model, there are a few caveats about the NPS and the touchpoints' data. Particularly, there are 3 adjustments we have to consider:\n",
    "1) Monthly statistical adjustment (weights): Each month, the NPS scores per cabin/haul are adjusted to fit a true sample of the global distribution of cabin/haul users. That is, for the NPS per cabin haul to be representative, it is first adjusted so that the sample of users from which it is computed is representative as well. That way, if by chance a month has only one passenger in, for example, Bussines-Long Haul, the associated NPS considers that that particular sample is not representtive of the normal distribution of Business Long Haul users. Unfortunatelly, this values are computed every month, and we wont have access to them at prediction time. \n",
    "2) Change of survey: On early december 2019 and on late december 2023 there have been changes on the survey handled to the clients that have considerelly affected the NPS score and the satisfaction per touchpoint. A fixed value (per cabin/haul and globally) is used to adjust 2019 and 2022 (plus december 2019). Those values are computed externally.\n",
    "3) C/H ponderation: On the global NPS computation, each cabin haul NPS is adjusted by a factor based on the percentaje of users that will fly on that particular cabine/haul. These values are fixed and at the moment of prediction we will have access to them."
